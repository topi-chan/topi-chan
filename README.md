- 👋 Hi, I’m @topi-chan! Which is a nickname that my buddies gave me as a child 😅 combined with my 'guilty-please', but conscious love of anime girls. 😳😓💁🏻‍♂️
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, backend web development (Djano and AIOHTTP) and #Data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write good tests 😅 and make a useful type hint.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool and useful (!) projects, preferably on libraries mentioned above, but it's not a necessity. Hint: I try to be environmentally conscious, especially when it comes to wild animals. I have commercial job secured.
- 💪🏼 In my job I develop a pretty advanced in-house financial mamagement system, as a part of very kind, but productive, international R&D team.
