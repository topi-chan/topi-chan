- 👋 Hi, I’m @topi-chan! Which is a nickname that my buddies gave me as a child 😳💁🏻‍♂️
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, backend web development (Djano and AIOHTTP) and #Data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write decent tests. 😅 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool and useful (!) projects, preferably on libraries mentioned above, but it's not a necessity. Hint: I try to be environmentally conscious, especially when it comes to wild animals. I have commercial job secured.

- 😼 You'll see commits here mostly on weekends, as my Company uses competitive repository provider. If you'll like to talk about coding or anything else really 😄, don't hesitate to contact me on e-mail adress aforementioned! I don't bite, really. 😬
- Also, I just like coding. 💁🏻‍♂️ I came from Consulting bussiness which, at some point, just felt like it isn't enough.
