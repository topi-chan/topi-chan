- 👋 Hi, I’m @topi-chan!
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, backend web development (Django, FastAPI and aiohttp) and Data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity stuff.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some cool and useful (!) projects, preferably on libraries mentioned above, but it's not a necessity. Hint: I try to be environmentally conscious, especially when it comes to wild animals. I have commercial job secured.
- 📫 How to reach me - by maciej.topolewski@gmail.com or LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/maciej-topolewski-643116a1/.
- 😼 You'll see commits here rarely, as my Company uses inhouse repository, as well as a project in which I work as a volunteer after hours. If you'll like to talk about coding or anything else really 😄, don't hesitate to contact me on e-mail adress aforementioned! I don't bite, really. 😬
- Also, I just like coding. 💁🏻‍♂️ I came from Consulting bussiness which, at some point, just felt like it wasn't enough, so I made my child's dream come true and learned how to programm (did some php/html web programming in early 2000's too). I played with computers since I was 6 y/o, my first one was PC 386 with stunning 40 MHz. I remember 5 inch floppy disks, DOS and Norton Commander - yes, I'm that old (well 35 actually).
I choose Python because I like snakes.
